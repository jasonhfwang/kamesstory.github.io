I want to rewrite my website such that it's based on NextJS. Here's some of the features I want. Keep it simple + concise + not overly abstracted. However, we do want the entire website to be themed, use Tailwind and keep styles in a way where we can adjust them easily.

## Impression

The goal of this refresh is to make the website more professional, and also easy to write / add new things. Professional meaning not that I'm going to be all serious, but that I'm high quality & mature doer / thinker. For instance, font choice is important here — nothing too round, but instead we can try a serif font for titles and then keep a mature looking san-serif for content. We can play around with this (think of dictionary entries).

Actually, the best option is to use serif fonts but in the style of terminals to be more computer-esque. In general, we can make everything more terminal-esque.

In general, in order to maintain a more serious theme, please use smaller font sizes.

In terms of color, we should just keep a dark mode — use Monokai Pro colors across the board.

Make it mobile-friendly too.

## Overall Layout

I want this to be in a column (50%) of the page width. It should just be the current landing page content. However, get rid of the links. No picture as well.

Instead, we should have multiple little sections under the intro. Each of these sections' content starts out as a standard size (scrambled), and unscrambles (use use-scramble) into the selected content, which is randomly pulled from a DB of potential content for that specific section. However, if you want to see the full list, you can hover over the section title and an arrow will appear. This section title is a link that is clickable and will go to another page. As of this refactor, none of these link pages will be accessible.

These sections are:

1. A Thing I've Built

This will be a section on things I've built, essentially list out projects that I've built. For now, fill with lorem ipsum text of various lengths besides the title of the thing I've built.

Here are a list of things I will include:

- CalderaJS
- Cohere
- AbbyCare
- Truthtr.ee
- Tech & Check
- mPower

2. A Thing I Do

This is a section on random things that I've done. The goal here is to showcase that I am a DOER, I just do things and delight in life. For now, fill with lorem ipsum text of various lengths.

The full list:
Driving U-Hauls in the City — talk about thrill, connecting to the vehicle as a driver, and what it means to be a good driver. Offering services to people in the city
Hosting Tea — add a email link to tea@jasonwa.ng
Taking over jazz bands — the power of just asking and leaning into the moment
Piano duets — how beautiful it is to create with somebody, play something you couldn't do alone
Dance — tension, push and pull, strength and beauty
Open Water Swimming — tranquility, being present, and breaking barriers
Web serials — when the goal is to maximize delight
Haikus — being precise with my feelings
Travel sketches — zeroing in on the moment, and basking in awe

3. A Thought I've Had

This will be the "stream" in content, it will be a mixture of microblog thoughts and longer form pieces. In the future I'll actually have a blog but for now, I will keep it this way.
