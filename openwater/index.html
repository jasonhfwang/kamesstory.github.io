            Growing up swimming in pools, I always envied bikers and runners â€”
            they got to move through the world, enjoying the scenery they
            passed. The world is full of storied races through epic landscapes â€”
            the New York Marathon, the Tour de France. Biking and running were
            fundamentally outward-facing, a communion with the world around us.

            Swimming was different. It was an act of tranquility, where I could
            dive into and get lost in the meditative rhythm of the water. I
            loved how introspective and contemplative it was. And while I also
            felt some invisible pull to the world of fun races and gorgeous
            landscapes, it was the realm of dryland. The expanse of the ocean
            and rivers were inaccessible, and dangerous. The swimmers who dared
            the rivers and oceans were "other" â€” those were stories of a
            mythical group of people that I did not belong to.

            I never knew it at the time, but that story would change once I
            moved to San Francisco. Looking back on it, it is somewhat
            surprising. The water in the Bay is brutal, reaching a maximum of 65
            F in the year, so swimming without a wetsuit feels like suicide. But
            the blessing of the Bay is that there's no shortage of beautiful
            things to look at, even if you're about to catch water-induced
            hypothermia. I still remember my first time swimming in Crissy
            Field, looking up out of the water and seeing the titanic arches of
            the Golden Gate Bridge towering above me. Nothing else in the world
            mattered. In some way, I felt the water connect me to the bridge, an
            invisible current that anchored me to that moment.

        <div class="content-body">
          <span>
            Of course, the Bay isn't just about stunning views â€” it's also
            steeped in history and legendary swims, the most famous of which is
            certainly the Escape from Alcatraz. Like many people, I thought that
            it was impossible, or a superhuman feat that only the most dedicated
            (and gifted) people could achieve. That turned out to be, like so
            many things we hesitate at, entirely assumed. During a random
            conversation with a friend, I decided to actually dig deeper, and
            found that there's groups of people who make the escape every year.
            San Francisco even has multiple clubs that host Alcatraz crossings
            every year, and they regularly welcome newcomers who want to try it
            for the first time.

            Suddenly, something became possible that I never even realized I
            truly desired â€” I too could echo stories, swimming in breathtaking
            scenery.

            How could I say no? So, I donned my suit and began training, and
            that was the start of my love for open water swimming.

        <div class="content-body">
          <span>
            Looking back, I'm shocked by how this simple realization has
            crystallized this new yearning inside me â€” the desire to enrich
            these gorgeous landscapes and make them deeply rewarding and
            meaningful by adding the epic challenge of an open water swim.
            Throughout my travels, my most meaningful trips have been those with
            a deeper connection, beyond the purely aesthetic and novel. Ever
            since my journey with open water swimming began, I've realized how
            many of those have been connected to my love of the open water. With
            Alcatraz under my belt, all I can think about is what's next.

              Alcatraz Invitational â†—</a

            , a 2 km swim across the San Francisco Bay from Alcatraz Island to
            the San Francisco shoreline. This is, of course, what the inmates
            from the prison on Alcatraz Island attempted. While we don't know if
            they succeeded, thankfully I am still verifiably alive and dry.

            , a 3.3 km swim across the Strait of Messina from the island of
            Sicily to the Italian mainland. This is the storied location of
            Scylla (six-headed monster) and Charybdis (giant whirlpool) in Greek
            mythology. It also happens to be cool because you can see on a
            global map the clear separation between the landmass you start on,
            and the landmass you end on.

            , a 4.5 km swim across the Hellespont (Dardanelles Strait) in
            Turkey. This strait is featured in countless myths (the site of
            Troy, the last part of the route of the legendary Heroic Journey of
            Jason and the Argonauts). It quite literally involves swimming
            across the continents, from Europe into Asia.

            Switzerland. There's no mythology here that I am attached to, but
            it's Lake Geneva and it's gorgeous, so why not.

            , 10 km swim from Cancun on the Mexican mainland to the island of
            Isla Mujeres. Once again, no mythology attached here, but everyone's
            been to Cancun and knows how beautiful the water is. It would be
            awesome to just swim up to an island paradise, walk out of the water
            into a bar, order a drink, and then just lie down and relax.

            Since I have no desire to become an extreme sports athlete, and at
            this point I'll have achieved the equivalent of a marathon in
            swimming, that's the end of my milestones for now. There are some
            other swims that are piquing my attention, though, so if you're
            interested please let me know:

              >Maui Channel Swim â†—</a
            >
            , 15.9 km swim from the island of Lanai to Maui, Hawai'i. This is
            absolutely epic â€” after this you can say you've swam (with a team)
            from one island of Hawai'i to another. As this is a relay swim with
            a team of up to 6 people, I figure that since this is essentially
            1.5 to 2 mi per person, this is doable for most people with OWS
            experience. Hit me up if you're interested and we can coordinate!
