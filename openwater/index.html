            Growing up swimming in pools, I always envied bikers and runners â€”
            they got to move through the world, enjoying the scenery they
            passed. The world is full of storied races through epic landscapes â€”
            the New York Marathon, the Tour de France. Biking and running were
            fundamentally outward-facing, a communion with the world around us.

            Swimming was different. It was an act of tranquility, where I could
            dive into and get lost in the meditative rhythm of the water. I
            loved how introspective and contemplative it was. But while I also
            felt some invisible pull to the world of fun races and gorgeous
            landscapes, it was the realm of dryland. The swimmers who dared the
            rivers and oceans were "other" â€” those were stories of a mythical
            group of people that I did not belong to.

            That story would change once I moved to San Francisco. Looking back,
            it is somewhat surprising that it's the case â€” the water in the Bay
            is brutal, reaching a maximum of 65 F in the year, so swimming
            without a wetsuit feels like suicide. But the blessing of the Bay is
            that there's no shortage of beautiful things to look at, even if
            you're about to get hypothermia. I still remember my first time
            swimming in Crissy Field, looking up out of the water and seeing the
            titanic arches of the Golden Gate Bridge towering above me. Nothing
            else in the world existed in that moment. In some way, the water was
            my bridge, an invisible current that anchored me in the world.

            The Bay also has one more advantage â€” it's steeped in history and
            legendary swims, the most famous of which is certainly the Escape
            from Alcatraz. Like many people, I thought that it was basically
            impossible, a superhuman feat only the most gifted people could
            achieve. Like so many things that hold us back, that turned out to
            be entirely an illusion. A random conversation with a friend led me
            to dig deeper. I found that there are groups of people who make the
            escape every year, and multiple clubs in San Francisco even host
            Alcatraz crossings every year. It turns out, they love welcoming
            newcomers who want to try it for the first time.

            How could I say no? So, I donned my suit and began training, and
            that was the start of my love for open water swimming.

            Looking back, this simple realization was the start of a new motif
            in my life. Throughout my travels, my most meaningful trips have
            been those with a deeper connection, beyond the purely aesthetic and
            novel. I'm delighted by the personal touches, the little quests that
            define these places in my experiences. Ever since my journey with
            open water swimming began, I've realized how many of those are
            connected to my love of the open water. Now, with Alcatraz under my
            belt, all I can think about is what's next.

            , a 2 km swim across the San Francisco Bay from Alcatraz Island to
            the San Francisco shoreline. This is what the inmates from the
            prison on Alcatraz Island attempted. Thankfully, while we don't know
            if they succeeded, I am still verifiably alive.

            , a 3.3 km swim across the Strait of Messina from the island of
            Sicily to the Italian mainland. This is the mythological location of
            Scylla (six-headed monster) and Charybdis (giant whirlpool) in Greek
            legend. When I swam there, they did warn us about dangerous rocks
            and whirlpools, so I suppose there's some truth to it :)

            , 15.9 km swim from the island of Lanai to Maui, Hawai'i. This is
            absolutely epic â€” after this you can say you've swam (with a team)
            from one island of Hawai'i to another. This is currently in the
            works for September 2026 with a partially assembled relay team of 6
            people. It's essentially 1.5 to 2 mi per person, so anybody who can
            swim Alcatraz should be good for this one too! Hit me up if you're
            interested and we can coordinate.

            , a 4.5 km swim across the Hellespont (Dardanelles Strait) in
            Turkey. This strait is featured in countless myths (the site of
            Troy, the last part of the route of the legendary Heroic Journey of
            Jason and the Argonauts). It quite literally involves swimming
            across the continents, from Europe into Asia.

            Switzerland. There's no mythology here that I am attached to, but
            it's Lake Geneva and it's gorgeous, so why not.

            , 10 km swim from Cancun on the Mexican mainland to the island of
            Isla Mujeres. Once again, no mythology attached here, but everyone's
            been to Cancun and knows how beautiful the water is. It would be
            awesome to just swim up to an island paradise, walk out of the water
            into a bar, order a drink, and then just lie down and relax.

            Since I have no desire to become an extreme sports athlete, and at
            this point I'll have achieved the equivalent of a marathon in
            swimming, that's the end of my milestones for now. There are some
            other swims that are piquing my attention, though, so if you're
            interested please let me know:
