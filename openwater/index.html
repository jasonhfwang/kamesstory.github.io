            As a swimmer growing up I've always been envious of this inherent
            opportunity that both bikers and runners have â€” that they're free
            from the confines of a pool or a gym. They can be a part of their
            environment and appreciate their surroundings while doing their
            sports. To me, swimming has been different. I've loved how
            introspective and contemplative it's been for me, a place where I
            can close my eyes and sink into the meditative rhythm of the water.
            But this world of marathon races and gorgeous surroundings was the
            realm of dryland, and of those precious few people who mastered
            swimming and therefore were qualified to brave the open waters.

            That changed ever since I moved to San Francisco and started doing
            open water swimming. The water in the San Francisco Bay is, I'll
            admit, somewhat daunting to step into the first time, given that
            temperatures there reach a maximum of 65F and therefore a wetsuit is
            all but required. But I've been blessed by San Francisco in, if not
            the temperature of the water, at least the plethora of beautiful
            things to look at while I'm freezing to death. There's nothing like
            looking up out of the water and seeing the arches of the famous
            Golden Gate Bridge looming in front of you, and realizing that
            you're right there in the water with it. In some strange sense, you
            feel like you're a part of the bridge.

            >It's not just views that are amazing in the Bay, but also the
            stories of famous swims that have taken place there, the most famous
            of which is certainly the escape from Alcatraz. Like many people, I
            thought that it was an impossible swim, or something that only
            uncommonly (and genetically) gifted people could achieve. To my
            surprise, I found not only that many people do it every year, but
            there are multiple groups hosting Alcatraz crossings every year, and
            I've even met club members who have completed it dozens of times.

            experience is how I've unlocked this new yearning inside me, the
            desire to do more and more epic physical feats. Before, I never had
            any urges to do anything like this. Now that I have Alcatraz under
            my belt, all I can think about is what's next.

            >, a 1.2 mile swim across the San Francisco Bay from Alcatraz Island
            to the San Francisco shoreline. This, of course, is what the inmates
            from the prison on Alcatraz Island attempted (and we don't know if
            they succeeded!) June 12th, 1962.

            >, a 3.3 km swim across the Strait of Messina from the island of
            Sicily to the Italian mainland. This is the strait mentioned in
            Greek mythology as the home of Scylla (six-headed monster) and
            Charybdis (giant whirlpool). It also happens to be cool because you
            can, on a map that views all of Europe, see the clear separation
            between the landmass you start on, and the landmass you end on.

            Turkey. This strait is featured in countless myths (the site of
            Troy, the last part of the route of the legendary Heroic Journey of
            Jason and the Argonauts). It quite literally involves swimming
            across the continents, from Europe into Asia.

            it's Lake Geneva and it's gorgeous, so why not.

            been to Cancun and knows how beautiful the water is. It would be
            awesome to just swim up to an island paradise, walk out of the water
            into a bar, order a drink, and then just lie down and relax.
