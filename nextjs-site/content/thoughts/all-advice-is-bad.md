title: All Advice is Bad
---

**All Advice is Bad** and it's your responsibility to parse what works for you. To do so, you must understand:

1. (X) What actually works for them
2. (Y) Their mental model of themselves, aka what they think works for them.
3. (M) Their mental model of you, aka what they think works for you.
4. (Z) What actually works for you

Their advice: `A = M(Y(X))`
How you should receive their advice: `Z(Y^-1((M^-1(A)))`
Apply this mathematical equation and profit ðŸ’°.
