...and it's your responsibility to parse what works for you. To do so, you must understand:

1. (T) What worked for them.
2. (M) Their mental model of you, aka what they think works for you.
3. (Y) What actually works for you.

Their advice: `A = M(T)`
How you should receive their advice: `Y(M^-1(A))`
Apply this mathematical equation and profit ðŸ’°.
