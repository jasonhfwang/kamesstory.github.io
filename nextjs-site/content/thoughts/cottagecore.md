title: Cottagecore

**Cottagecore:** I've been obsessed with the idea of product and livestock variants for a while now, and I've been thinking about how amazing it'd be to own a farm where all the produce are variants from before the early 1900s breeding programs (e.g. actual heirloom tomatoes and heritage-breed chickens). Even though crops have been "genetically modified" (phenotypes selected for by people) throughout all of history, I suspect the historical selection criteria for a "good plant" was much more holistic than ours in the modern-day (e.g. biasing primarily towards taste rather than superficial optics and size).

On that note, I don't know why people don't do restaurant versions of [Tasting History](https://www.youtube.com/@TastingHistory) â€” I would love to go to a restaurant specializing in ancient Roman, Chinese or [indigenous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocm6DRIF9oU&t=1s) food.
