**Forever Clothing:** I used to chase timeless fashion by sticking to high-quality basics, thinking I was above trends. But diving deeper into fashion made me realize I feel best when I take what's good from trends while reflecting who I actually am. Streetwear is a great example — while I don't vibe with the anarchic edge, I love how it plays with form and silhouettes.

Now I realize that if a piece captures some core kernel of who I am, it's timeless _for me_. Here's what "forever clothing" needs:

1. Accent my good physical qualities, obscure bad ones.
2. Avoid being trendy while taking inspiration from the trend.
3. Convey aspects of who I am (especially if they aren't apparent).

A piece must excel in at least 2 of these and not violate the third. My goal is to build a wardrobe around this.
