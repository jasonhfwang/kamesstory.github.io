title: forever clothing
---

For a long time, I've been obsessed with the idea of timeless fashion. The idea of not being pulled around by the latest trend is very gravitating. In the past this meant that I focused only on high-quality basics and styles that have withstood the test of time, which I thought allowed me to remain above the trends. Through my recent dives deeper into fashion, however, I've realized that I feel at my best when what I wear takes what's good from the trend while also reflecting fundamental aspects of myself. As an example, I've been diving more into streetwear recently, and I still don't necessarily like the anarchic or overly edgy aspects of streetwear (this clashes with my personality). However, I love the way streetwear plays with form and silhouettes, and how streetwear can be both presentable and expressive while being non-conforming.

Like a typical tech bro, I've clearly been missing several critical aspects to my fashion sense â€” creativity and self-expression, which I'm sure was obvious to practically everybody else, but unfortunately eluded little old me. In the pursuit of presentability, I neglected personality. My perspective now is that once I can find any core kernel of who I am and can match it with dress, then it's also a timeless piece _for me_. Here's some qualities that "forever clothing" should have in my eyes:

1. Accent my personal good physical qualities, and obscure bad ones.
2. Avoid being trendy while taking inspiration from the trend.
3. Convey aspects of who I am (especially if they aren't apparent).

To belong, a piece must excel in at least 2 of the above principles and at least not violate the remaining condition. My fashion goal is now to find more of these pieces and build a wardrobe that captures these ideas.
