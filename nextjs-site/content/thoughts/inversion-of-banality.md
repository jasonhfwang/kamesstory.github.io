title: inversion of banality
---

The way "the other" is depicted in fantasy games, movies, and art can be so much more sophisticated and interesting. The basic template nowadays is to depict "evil" as something clearly alien, such as with architectures of bone and tattered canvas / hide (or brutalist black stone/steel, think Mordor). But the best antagonists are those with nuance, subvert expectations, or rely on the flawed perspectives of the protagonists. It should be the same when it comes to artistic depictions of evil in fantasy. I was recently looking at [some examples of traditional architecture in Guizhou](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cjz71ckKgQO/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=), and there was this strange perspective shift in my head, where I suddenly saw this beautiful wood architecture as grotesque, essentially buildings composed of massacred trees instead of elegant structures. This was interesting because it was one of those situations where something I've been trying to do more — seeing "more clearly" — led to a complete inversion of experience of something totally normal. It'd be interesting to induce these more subtle senses of unease reliably, since we would have to reconcile a clear aesthetic appreciation of beauty with something slightly unsettling.
