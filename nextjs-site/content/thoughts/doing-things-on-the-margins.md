title: The Importance of Doing Things on the Margins

**The Importance of Doing Things on the Margins:** One of the things I've noticed my extremely efficient friends do, which I tend to do when I'm productive and lapse in when I'm not, is doing things on the margins. That means just starting or continuing work even if you don't know that there's enough time to actually "complete" the entire thing. I think this is powerful because a lot of the time, our days have a ton of marginal periods of time. It's so easy to just fall into the trap of cleaning up small things in those margins — and that's fair, if those small things are truly high priority — but it tends to lead to lots of unimportant things being done, and not enough time for the big rocks to be cleared. Instead, just start on the important things. Incremental and relentless focus on the most important things to tackle is better than completing unimportant things.
