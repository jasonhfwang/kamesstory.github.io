title: the suitcase index
---

I was just in China and was struck by the experience of just being able to roll my suitcase from my house in one city to the hotel in another, without it really ever leaving my hands. In the US, this is totally a foreign idea, as suitcases leave our hands almost at every junction. The car ride from the house to the airport, the security checkpoints, the carry on overhead bins, the car ride in the last mile, etc. China was different because public transportation and high-speed rail makes it so easy to just roll it continuously to the endpoint. I call this in my head the suitcase index, indicating the percentage of time that a suitcase can be in your hands or easily accessible, which is a proxy for the quality and usability of the public infrastructure.
