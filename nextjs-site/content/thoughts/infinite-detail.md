title: infinite detail
---

As we grow older and see more things, our brains add neural shortcuts that template experiences and reduce their emotional impact. This is why we don't appreciate a scene nearly as much the third time, as the first. The best way I've found to combat this is to force myself to pay attention to details, such as when you paint. Even if you just sit down and stare, it's so hard to notice the details of the texture of the leaves on the trees, and the rock, and the sea. My goal is to carry a tool to zero in on the present whenever I'm traveling, whether that's a tiny watercolor book, a camera, or a little poetry notebook.
