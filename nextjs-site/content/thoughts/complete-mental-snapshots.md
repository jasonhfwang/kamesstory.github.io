Capturing the quintessential essence of thoughts / attitudes / beliefs to remember far into the future is actually very difficult. It isn't as simple as writing thoughts down â€” there's underlying modes of perception and belief systems that change over time, and to fully contextualize thoughts you need to capture that hidden essence as well.

For example, a few years ago I wrote this down: "Most of people's time is spent inventing things to do, in order to avoid doing important work that they're dreading." This feels like a vague truism, but I have no idea as to what prompted this thought (and what made it feel like such an important insight at that point in my life, that I wrote it down). It's pretty evident that looking at that quote, the real thought to note down was buried at the intersection between those words, and the specific circumstance in my life that made that idea critically important. But I don't have any recollection of that anymore, and none of that contextualizing information has been written down. I've recently become more interested in capturing those ideas more completely.
