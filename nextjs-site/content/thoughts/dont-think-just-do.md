title: Don't Think Just Do
---

**Don't Think Just Do:** As the legendary sage Wei Wu says, ["be a dumb ass"](https://x.com/WuWei113/status/1892333677587153389). I've heard this echoed time and time again, such as by my close, very cracked friend who frequently says, "thinking bad doing good". Generally, it's easy to overtheorize and overoptimize, and my friends who do so tend to constantly get stuck constantly on what appears to be trivial matters. It's like watching a truck furiously spinning wheels while stuck in mud. In actuality, very few actions are irreversible and structured in a way where incremental progress does not shed as much light as initial-stage theorizing does. So, just be a dumbass and do!
