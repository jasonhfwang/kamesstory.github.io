title: Mindful Indulgence
---

**Mindful Indulgence:** I recently was chatting with a new friend who had a transformative experience at a Vipassana meditation retreat, and I started thinking a lot about my own habits and forms of relaxation, and how I don't necessarily feel the most relaxed or satisfied when I just indulge cravings. In contrast, I'm much more fulfilled when I'm deliberate in enjoying things instead of just mindlessly giving in without agency. This doesn't mean necessarily always holding out, although I'm guilty of enjoying the perverse satisfaction of doing that too (throwback to my fond freshman year memories with Alex, eating bland salads without dressing every week). Instead it means occasionally taking the time to put in more effort, focus, & dive into the enjoyment of things that give me pleasure. That includes indulging, ironically â€” if I want to eat something sweet, I don't want to simply eat it while watching something else. I should instead savor it and turn it into an entire, soul-satisfying experience.
