After my recent health scare, there's been this large fundamental shift in my feelings on exercise. I've read for a long time about how exercise is [a celebration](https://external-preview.redd.it/VDPvosbeTFKlG1CXSzynW6L-ifguJBMw8TFBeshnX68.jpg?auto=webp&s=88c3da021cc0f3003992ddc6e5904221ceb0c119) of what I can do, not a punishment required to maintain my health. But there's always a disconnect between rationally knowing and emotionally embracing an idea. Once I felt what I thought were the limitations of my body, I finally felt that click in my mind. It's such a beautiful feeling to move and feel so alive when I do.
