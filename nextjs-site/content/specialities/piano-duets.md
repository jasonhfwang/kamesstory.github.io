title: Playing Piano Duets
---

**Playing Piano Duets:** I love playing duets with people. Think about all the things about your partner you have to be in tune with — in real time, you must feel their hesitation, their struggle with notes, when they are in the flow, and where they want the piece to go. I may also have gotten rusty over the years so it's nice to play something beautiful and complex with a little help... if this sounds fun to you, let's go to GGP and play on the piano there!
