title: Playing Piano Duets
---

**Playing Piano Duets:** I love playing duets with people. You have to connect deeply with them, feel their hesitations or where they want the piece to go. I also have gotten rusty over the years so it's nice to play something beautiful and complex with a little help... if this sounds fun to you, let's go to GGP and play on the piano there!
