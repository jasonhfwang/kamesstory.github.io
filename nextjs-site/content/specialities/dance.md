**Dancing:** It's rare in life to have the opportunity to become aware of every part of your body, and submerge into an flow state of expression. So many lessons to learn here — from playing with tension, being comfortable looking awkward, and leaning towards while controlling expression. Plus, the music's great too :) Come join me @ City Dance if you're interested!
