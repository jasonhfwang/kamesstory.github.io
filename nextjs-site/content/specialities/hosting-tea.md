title: Hosting Tea

**Hosting Tea:** There's something magical about tea. Many people experience it as a warm comforting mug on a cold day, but there's so many ways it can touch people. To me, the experience of tea is a bit of addictive curiosity — you sip and get brief glimpses of its subtleties, before it fades back to a rounded warmth and you go back for another round. That cycle of awareness and peace becomes a meditation of sorts. I used to do a fair amount of gong fu cha and hope to do so more in the future.
