title: Hosting Tea

**Hosting Tea:** Tea is ease, relaxed conversation, and a lightened load. It's an open meadow in a dense forest — a breath of fresh air before you continue on your journey (sometimes literally, as in the case of several of my guests recently). I used to do a fair amount of gong fu cha and hope to do more. [Reach out at me here](hi+tea@jasonwa.ng) if you'd like to join!
