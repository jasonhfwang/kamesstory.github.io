title: Driving U-Hauls in the City
---

There's nothing like the thrill of weaving a chunky box on wheels through tiny city streets. I love the feeling of sitting high up and the vantage point it offers, and the connection I have to develop with the truck — to learn its boundaries and its tolerances. It's fun! I've offered my driving services a few times, and looking forward to more :)
