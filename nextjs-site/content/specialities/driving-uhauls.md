title: Driving U-Hauls in the City
---

**Driving U-Hauls in the City:** There's nothing like the thrill of weaving a chunky box on wheels through tiny city streets. I love the feeling of sitting high up and the vantage point it offers, and the connection I have to develop with the truck — which is necessary to drive intuitively within its boundaries and tolerances. It's so fun! I've offered my driving services a few times, and [looking forward to doing so again](mailto:hi@jasonwa.ng) if you're interested :)
