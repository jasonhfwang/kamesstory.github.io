**Web Serials:** When I want to be delighted, I turn to web serials. There's something about the form, the space they give themselves to worldbuild, and the sheer creativity that I've not found captured in other literature. There's worlds of Victorian-era biopunk, some that are shaped by metaphysical story tropes, or others that are filled with complex webs of superhero politics.
