title: Open Water Swimming

**Open Water Swimming:** Swimming in the brackish Bay water sounds hardcore, but it's actually one of the most grounding and tranquil things I've ever experienced. Because you're out in the middle of the water with no distractions, and you're quite literally submerged in the permeating cold, it's impossible to not be present. You're forced to truly reckon with the world around you and therefore be a part of it — the perfect presence meditation. I've swam from Alcatraz and between Sicily and Italy, and now I'm looking for more folks for our next race across the Maui Channel — [let me know if you're interested](mailto:hi+swim@jasonwa.ng)!
