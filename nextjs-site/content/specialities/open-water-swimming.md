title: Open Water Swimming

It sounds hardcore, but it's actually one of the most grounding and tranquil experiences I've ever had. Being out in the middle of the water, with nothing else to do or experience, is some of the most present I've ever been. To me, it's meditation. I'm looking for more folks for our next race across the Maui Channel, [let me know if you're interested](hi+swim@jasonwa.ng)!
