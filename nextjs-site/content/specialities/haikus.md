title: Writing Haikus

**Writing Haikus:** One of the most beautiful parts of life is those fleeting instances when you're captivated by something you see, do, or feel. The problem is that it's so hard to recapture that exact same impression later, when looking back. To help me take an emotional and mental photograph, per se, I've written dozens of haikus across many little moments in my life. Every time I read them back, the echo of these moments runs through me.
