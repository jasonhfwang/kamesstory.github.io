title: Writing Haikus

**Writing Haikus:** One of the most beautiful parts of travel is those fleeting moments when you're captivated by something you see, do, or taste. The problem is always that it's so hard to recollect those moments later. To help me capture those instances, I've written dozens of haikus across my many trips. It requires precision and understanding your own perspective, everything captured in just seventeen syllables.
