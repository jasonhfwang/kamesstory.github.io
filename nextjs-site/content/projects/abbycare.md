**AbbyCare** is an AI home health agency that trains and pays caregivers for delivering home health care. It's been clear to me for years that the focus of healthcare will shift towards the home, and that hospitals will increasingly become relegated to specialty procedures. I was lucky enough to join early as Founding Engineer and helped build out our product, including our operating system for internal teams + clinicians and our caregiver-facing software. I explicitly wanted to leave SaaS and build a world-class services company from first principles (as 70%+ of the US is services). Incredibly excited at how quickly the team has grown and taken over the space — details coming soon!
