title: AbbyCare

**AbbyCare** is a tech-enabled healthcare startup helping family members get paid for the caregiving they do. I looked for years for a startup that I felt addressed a problem that I was close to, was grounded in the real world, and was a rocketship. I was lucky enough to find this one early and joined as Founding Engineer. During my time here I built out the core infrastructure + tools that our teams used to deliver care to patients.
