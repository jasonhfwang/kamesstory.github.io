title: AbbyCare

**AbbyCare** is an AI home health agency that trains and pays caregivers for delivering home health care. It's been clear to me for years that the focus of healthcare will shift towards the home, and that hospitals will increasingly become relegated to specialty procedures. The arrival of general-purpose robotics and self-driving has only solidified this view. I was lucky enough to join early as Founding Engineer and helped build out our product, including our operating system for internal teams + clinicians and our caregiver-facing software. I explicitly wanted to leave SaaS and learn what a world-class services company could look like (as 70%+ of the US is services), and I'm incredibly excited that the team continues to rocket upwards and take over the space!
