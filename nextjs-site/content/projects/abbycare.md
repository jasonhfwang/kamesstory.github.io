**AbbyCare** is a tech-enabled healthcare startup helping family members get paid for the caregiving they do. I've always been excited about the potential of technology to push society towards how it should be, and I looked for years for a startup that I felt addressed problems grounded in the real world + was a rocketship. I was lucky enough to join early as Founding Engineer and help build out our entire product, including our tools for nurses and operational automations. Building an operations / services company is so different from what we're used to in SaaS, and I loved every moment of it.
