title: Cohere

**Cohere** is a startup I cofounded (YC S20), backed by the founders of Ramp + Elad Gil + Naval Ravikant. We built cobrowsing and AI support tools for teams around the world. I helped build our general cobrowsing + DOM mutation engine, which streamed our customers' webpages to our client dashboard, so agents could help users with any support or onboarding questions. In addition to that, I led sales + growth, acquiring our first few customers + Enterprise contracts.
