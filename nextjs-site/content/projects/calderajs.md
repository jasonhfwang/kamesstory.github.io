title: CalderaJS
---

**CalderaJS** is a server-side execution framework that my cofounders and I created. This is React's answer to Elixir's Phoenix Liveview, and lets all code + business logic run centrally on the server while simply streaming DOM updates to the frontend. This ended up inspiring the starutp I founded, Cohere, which ran on related DOM streaming premises.
