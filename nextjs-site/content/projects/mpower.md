**mPower** was a startup I cofounded delivering custom cold storage solutions to small scale farmers. Many farmers in India, for instance, are frequently gouged by middlemen because they have no choice but to sell crops at predatory prices, since the alternative is to let the crops go bad. I helped build our cold storage tech and with fundraising. We ended up divesting this to local operators within the markets we operated in, so we could continue with our studies.
