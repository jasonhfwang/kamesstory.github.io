          Web serials are little-known in the literary world but feature stories
          with incredibly deep worldbuilding and intricate storylines.
          Historically, feuilletons have been home to world-famous literary
          works (e.g. The Count of Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers, and Great
          Expectations), which were originally published as serials. The
          modern-day continuation of serials hosted on the web, supported by
          creator platforms like Patreon, is allowing an entire new generation
          of writers to build worlds and create stories on their own terms, as
          opposed to traditional writers who are dependent on the approval and
          creative interests of publishing companies. This has produced a huge
          selection of daring and creative works, spanning genres and ideas that
          are not well represented in the literary cosmos of published books. As
          a longtime fan of the scene, here are some of my favorites:

              href="https://parahumans.wordpress.com/"
              target="_blank"
              >Worm and Ward ↗</a
            >, a hyper-realistic superhero story that makes The Boys / Marvel
            feel as shallow as DC. It follows the story of a teenager with a
            seemingly terrible superpower who wants to do good, but through a
            series of twists and turns has no choice but to become a villain.
            Amazing at exploring the psychology of superpowered individuals,
            interaction and application of superpowers, and societal dynamics /
            interests that would need to exist in the world for typical
            superhero tropes to be realistic.

              target="_blank"
              >Mother of Learning ↗</a
            >, a progression fantasy following an academy student who is trapped
            in an endless time loop and has to figure out why he's there and how
            to escape. A mix of Groundhog Day + Harry Potter + Sherlock Holmes,
            this is a story with a delightful hard magic system that is somehow
            both deeply intricate and understandable. Details matter, and
            there's clues to understanding the situation everywhere — if you
            miss them once, well, repetition is the mother of learning!

              >A Practical Guide to Evil ↗</a
            >, a story set in a world where the logic of stories — their tropes,
            roles, and narratives — actually drive the world. It follows a girl
            Named the Squire, apprenticed to the Black Knight who conquered her
            homeland. One of the most unique universes I've ever seen, with
            brilliant characters navigating a chess-like board of stories where
            one misstep can place them in a Role where they are destined to die.

            >, a biopunk story that follows several orphans in a world where
            bioengineering is developed in the early 1800s. A surprisingly
            personal and introspective thriller in a very unique, alien setting.
