          Web serials are little-known in the literary world but feature stories
          with incredibly deep worldbuilding and intricate storylines.
          Historically, feuilletons have been home to world-famous literary
          works (e.g. The Count of Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers, and Great
          Expectations), which were originally published as serials. The
          modern-day continuation of serials hosted on the web, supported by
          creator platforms like Patreon, is allowing an entire new generation
          of writers to build worlds and create stories on their own terms, as
          opposed to traditional writers who are dependent on the approval and
          creative interests of publishing companies. This has produced a huge
          selection of daring and creative works, spanning genres and ideas that
          are not well represented in the literary cosmos of published books. As
          a longtime fan of the scene, here are some of my favorites:
        </div>
        <div class="content-body">
          <li></li>
          <p>
            <a href="">Worm and Ward ↗</a>, a hyper-realistic superhero story
            that makes The Boys / Marvel feel as shallow as DC. It follows the
            story of a teenager who wants to do good but through a series of
            twists and turns is forced to become a villain to do so. Amazing at
            exploring the psychology of superpowered individuals, and societal
            dynamics / interests that would need to exist in the world for
            typical superhero tropes to be realistic.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-body">
          <li></li>
          <p>
            <a href="">Twig ↗</a>, a biopunk story that follows several orphans
            in a world where bioengineering is developed in the early 1800s. A
            surprisingly personal and introspective thriller in a very unique,
            alien setting.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-body">
          <li></li>
          <p>
            <a href="">Mother of Learning ↗</a>, a progression fantasy following
            an academy student who is trapped in an endless time loop and has to
            figure out why he's there and how to escape. A mix of Groundhog Day
            + Harry Potter + Sherlock Holmes, this is a story with a delightful
            hard magic system that is somehow both deeply intricate and
            understandable. Details matter, and there's clues to understanding
            the situation everywhere — if you miss them once, well, repetition
            is the mother of learning!
