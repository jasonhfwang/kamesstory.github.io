            Web serials are extremely underrepresented in the literary world, so
            they're often dismissed out-of-hand as shallower, less sophisticated
            spectres of published works. I've always found this to be bizarre.
            Historically, world-famous literary works like The Count of Monte
            Cristo, The Three Musketeers, and Great Expectations were originally
            published as serials in newspaper
            <i>feuilletons</i>. Their modern-day counterparts on the web,
            supported by creator platforms like Patreon, is enabling an entire
            new generation of writers complete control over the style and terms
            on which they tell their stories, avoiding the high degree of
            dependency on the approval and interests of publishing companies
            that traditional writers face. This has resulted in a selection of
            wildly creative works, spanning genres and ideas that are not
            well-explored in the literary cosmos of published books. As a
            longtime fan of the scene, here are some of my favorites:

              href="https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/"
              target="_blank"
              >Worm and Ward ↗</a
            >, a hyper-realistic superhero story that makes The Boys / Marvel
            feel as shallow as DC. It follows the story of a teenager with a
            seemingly mediocre superpower who is forced to become a villain and
            dives head-first, unprepared, into the world of 'capes'. Amazing at
            exploring the psychology of superpowered individuals, interaction
            and application of superpowers, and societal dynamics / interests
            that would need to exist in the world for typical superhero tropes
            to be realistic.

              >Mother of Learning ↗</a
            >, a progression fantasy following a magic-academy student who gets
            trapped in an endless time loop and has to figure out why he's there
            and how to escape. A mix of Groundhog Day + Harry Potter + Sherlock
            Holmes, this is a story with a delightful hard magic system that is
            somehow both deeply intricate and understandable. No deus ex
            machinas or handwaved logic here — when details are revealed,
            everything clicks like you knew it all along.

              >A Practical Guide to Evil ↗</a
            >, a story set in a world where the logic of stories — their tropes,
            roles, and narratives — actually drive the world. It follows a girl
            Named the Squire, apprenticed to the Black Knight who conquered her
            homeland. One of the most unique universes I've ever seen, with
            brilliant characters navigating a chess-like board of Stories where
            one misstep can place them in a Role where they are destined to die.

              >Twig ↗</a
            >, a biopunk story that follows several orphans in a world where
            bioengineering is developed in the early 1800s. A surprisingly
            personal and introspective thriller in a very unique, alien setting.
