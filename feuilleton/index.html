            I'm a huge fan of web serials. It's a niche interest, but my opinion
            is that web serials are both the future of writing and its powerful
            medium. While the general public consensus is that they're cheap or
            trashy â€” admittedly, some works fit the stereotype â€” I've spent
            enough years in the community to have seen stars that shine more
            brightly than the most celebrated works of popular fiction. People
            dream of Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere, or marvel at the rich sands of
            Dune, but the most compelling worlds I've seen have been found
            online.

            This obviously is a bold claim, but online fiction has structural
            advantages over traditionally published works. The least
            controversial of these is that online fiction uses a new business
            model that is much more sustainable and thus favorable to the
            author, instead of traditional publisher-led distribution. This
            model has rollover effects to the readership â€” specifically, a large
            number of people have easy access to works, while the most devoted
            fans have more opportunities to interact with and explore their
            favorite franchises. Additionally, the reduced reliance on
            publishers removes filters that enable more creative and interesting
            works to appear. Most importantly, however, the unique medium of
            online fiction gives a massive advantage to works that are
            web-native, by opening up entirely new modes of interaction and
            story exploration that weren't possible before.

            Among these factors, the economics of web serials lead to the most
            dramatic set of effects. While people typically associate free
            things with cheaper value and lower quality, in a world with
            unlimited, zero marginal cost distribution, this assumption breaks
            down. The true cost of writing a book is the worldbuilding and
            creative IP of the author, which is effectively a constant effort.
            The final price of the good doesn't correlate with any marginal
            production cost, but is purely correlated with the gravity and
            cultural capital of the IP, which grows and matures continuously
            over time.

            As a result, authors can utilize fundamentally different economics
            than the business model of traditional printing businesses. Instead
            of deriving value from the distribution of the story, authors
            monetize the continuous attention from the true fans of their
            series. Similar to how people pay exorbitant amounts of money for
            Eras Tour tickets or exclusive merch drops, obsessed fans subscribe
            to advanced chapters and special story-shaping privileges. Authors
            break out from the power dynamics of an author-publisher
            relationship, and gain the ability to extract value directly from
            the stories they're building.

            >What does this look like in terms of numbers? For the traditional
            publisher-led model, sources like
            <a href="https://bookstat.com/" target="_blank">Bookstat</a> paint a
            bleak picture of revenues for the majority of authors, showing that
            achieving even self-supporting incomes with a book is impossible for
            the vast majority of authors. Even in the biggest success cases,
            publishers end up taking a hefty chunk of the revenue.

            This is different with online fiction, native to the age of the
            internet. Works are mostly free to view and publish new chapters
            weekly, just like our favorite Netflix shows, or the great literary
            works of old in their newspaper feuilletons (see:
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo"
              target="_blank"
              >The Count of Monte Cristo</a
            >). Creators use platforms like Patreon to give exclusive benefits
            to their most devoted fans, such as a measure of influence over the
            story, a community with other fans, and most importantly advance
            viewing of the chapters. Li Jin's

              >1,000 True Fans</a
            >) both show the potential of this model â€” just by charging patrons
            $5/mo, a simple audience of 1,700 fans will net an author a steady
            six-figure income. This absolutely changes the way authors can
            support themselves.

            There are also structural factors that tend to improve the quality
            of stories. While publishers have played an important role in
            distribution because they are a quality filter on the entrance of
            new books into the market, they also have front-loaded distribution
            costs, meaning that they can only take a risk on a book if they
            predict it will do well. As a result, they can raise the floor on
            the quality of books that come out, but also fundamentally limit the
            distribution + success of works that break the mold.

            Web serials are a different story. Authors are free to publish
            whatever and whenever they want, and can be wildly more creative
            with the structure, themes, and form of the stories they write. The
            result is that while the average story quality does plummet, the
            best works soar.

            This, in addition to the fundamental medium on which online fiction
            takes place, enables entirely new dimensions of storytelling. For
            instance, worlds can be uniquely meticulous in their detail yet
            breathtaking in their expansiveness. In a web serial, the authors
            can offer readers a branching web of optional side-stories accessed
            by embedded links, to be explored at a user's leisure. Want to
            investigate an intriguing personal relationship, or just dive deeper
            into this obscure aspect of the world? Authors can also play with
            unique story forms, such as hidden (black) text indicating secret
            events hidden in the background, only revealable if you suspect
            something and highlight the right areas.

            What I'm particularly excited about is how this world is just
            getting started. There are so many ways for literature to continue
            evolving, once it adapts to the expressive power of the internet and
            technology. One key idea is interactivity, harkening to prehistoric
            oral traditions, which involved the audience as participants in the
            stories being told. Another is personalization â€” books are static,
            but people are individuals, preferring slightly different stories,
            perhaps ones with a greater focus on character development, or
            cultural worldbuilding, or political intrigue. Web serials are
            swimming in the water of technology, and we can expect to see so
            many new literary experiences in the upcoming few years as people
            discover what this old medium, taken in a new light, can do.

            As a longtime fan of the scene, I'm proud to support so many
            incredible authors and stories. If you're interested in jumping down

            >, a story set in a world where the logic of stories â€” their tropes,
            roles, and narratives â€” actually drive the world. It follows a girl
            Named the Squire, apprenticed to the Black Knight who conquered her
            homeland. One of the most unique universes I've ever seen, with
            intelligent characters navigating a chess-like board of Stories
            where one misstep can place them in a Role where their Fate is to
            die.

            villain, and dives head-first, unprepared, into the world of
            'capes'. Amazing at exploring the psychology of superpowered
            individuals, interaction and application of superpowers, and the
            types of societal dynamics / interests that would need to exist in
            the world for typical superhero tropes to be realistic.

            and how to escape. A mix of Groundhog Day + Harry Potter + Sherlock
            Holmes, this is a story with a delightful hard magic system that is
            somehow both deeply intricate and understandable. There's no deus ex
            machinas or handwaved logic here â€” when things are revealed, you can
            immediately see how subtle hints in the past yield the underlying
            laws that underpin the entire world.
