            I love web serials. For a long time, I've been frustrated by how
            most people regard literature written online â€”Â as something cheap,
            trashy, or overly gratifying in nature. Yes, there's some truth to
            that stereotype â€”Â as in any case where the production of content is
            not limited, the vast majority of works are of subpar or middling
            quality. But that same non-existent filter also makes it easy for
            daring, wildly creative ideas to emerge from the rough,
            unconstrained by the misaligned interests of publishing companies.
            Web serials are literature taken to the age of the internet â€”Â why
            curate at production when you can curate the end result? Sinking
            thousands of dollars to print a book is a ludicrously capital-heavy
            way to share stories when you can achieve unlimited distribution,
            and avoid editorial generification, with the web. Without editors to
            massage stories into the known molds that can preditably sell, and
            with new writers turning to more lucrative platforms such as Patreon
            to fuel their writing, web serials have flourished, containing
            incredibly interesting and varied worlds. The longer form allows
            worldbuilding to happen in a more natural progression, while the
            expressiveness of the web bring stories to life.

            And this world is just getting started. There are so many ways for
            the way we consume literature and interact with worlds to change.
            One element is interactivity, harkening back to oral traditions,
            which involved the audience as participants in the stories being
            told. Another is personalization â€”Â  a book is static, but people
            prefer slightly different stories, perhaps ones with a greater focus
            on character development, or cultural worldbuilding, or political
            intrigue. Web serials swim in the water of technology, and we can
            expect to see so many new literary experiences in the upcoming few
            years as people discover what these new platforms can do.

            As a longtime fan of the scene, I'm proud to support so many authors
            and their incredible stories. Here are some of my favorites:

        <!--             
          non-existent filter and endless production -> exercise in curation but why curate at
          production when you can curate the end result? why sink thousands? -->
        <!-- Endless reimaginings of worlds â€”Â what if Pokemon were realistic? -->
        <!-- It's an indulging in curiosity and a playfulness that eclipses
          literary norms  -->
        <!-- Worlds I've never seen or think anybody has talked
          about  -->
        <!-- The form! Colors and font sizes and ...  -->
        <!-- The episodic reading,
          hanging onto every chapter, chatting with the community -> the great
          oral tradition, before writers dictated their worlds and dragged
          everyone else in their wake  -->
        <!-- It's so deep because there's no
          publishing company to make the story more "generic" or conform to
          the traditional arcs. -->

              >Worm and Ward â†—</a
            >, a hyper-realistic superhero story that makes The Boys / Marvel
            feel as shallow as DC. It follows the story of a teenager with a
            seemingly mediocre superpower who is forced to become a villain and
            dives head-first, unprepared, into the world of 'capes'. Amazing at
            exploring the psychology of superpowered individuals, interaction
            and application of superpowers, and societal dynamics / interests
            that would need to exist in the world for typical superhero tropes
            to be realistic.

              >A Practical Guide to Evil â†—</a
            >, a story set in a world where the logic of stories â€”Â their tropes,
            roles, and narratives â€”Â actually drive the world. It follows a girl
            Named the Squire, apprenticed to the Black Knight who conquered her
            homeland. One of the most unique universes I've ever seen, with
            brilliant characters navigating a chess-like board of Stories where
            one misstep can place them in a Role where they are destined to die.

            >, a biopunk story that follows several orphans in a world where
            bioengineering is developed in the early 1800s. A surprisingly
            personal and introspective thriller in a very unique, alien setting.

              >Mother of Learning â†—</a
            >, a progression fantasy following a magic-academy student who gets
            trapped in an endless time loop and has to figure out why he's there
            and how to escape. A mix of Groundhog Day + Harry Potter + Sherlock
            Holmes, this is a story with a delightful hard magic system that is
            somehow both deeply intricate and understandable. No deus ex
            machinas or handwaved logic here â€” when details are revealed,
            everything clicks like you knew it all along.
