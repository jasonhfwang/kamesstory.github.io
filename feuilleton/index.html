            I'm a huge fan of web serials. It absolutely is a niche preference,
            especially given that there's not a lot of talk about literature
            written in public online, but my opinion is that web serials are
            both the future of writing and the most powerful medium that one can
            write in. The general public consensus, of course, seems to be that
            anything of the sort is something cheap or trashy â€” and admittedly,
            that stereotype does hold water for a large portion of online
            fiction â€” but I've spent enough years digging around the community,
            watching it grow, to know that the best online works are stars that
            shine just as brightly as the most celebrated works of popular
            fiction. People dream of Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere, or marvel at
            the rich sands of Dune, but the most compelling worlds I have seen
            have been found online.

            So why do I think this? Online fiction's importance yet obscurity
            comes down to several key factors. Firstly, people associate free
            things with cheaper value and lower quality. This isn't
            unreasonable, since generally if a good is higher quality and
            therefore has a higher cost of production, prices must rise as a
            result to preserve margins. This makes sense for objects that
            operate on per-unit economics, but of course in a world with
            unlimited, zero marginal cost distribution, this assumption breaks
            down. The true cost of writing a book is the worldbuilding and
            creative IP of the author, which is effectively a constant effort.
            The final price of the good doesn't correlate with any marginal
            production cost, but is purely correlated with the gravity and
            cultural capital of the IP.

            This results in fundamentally different economics than the business
            model of traditional printing businesses. Instead of deriving value
            from the distribution of the story, authors can monetize the
            attention and the true fans of their series, which is not limited by
            distribution nor by any arbtirary milestones within the development
            of a story. The result is a system where true fans pay money to
            express their allegiance and love. Similar to how people pay
            exorbitant amounts of money for Eras Tour tickets or exclusive merch
            drops, obsessed fans subscribe to advanced chapters and special
            story-shaping privileges. Authors therefore break out from the power
            dynamics of a predatory relationship with publishers, and gain the
            ability to extract value directly from the stories they're building.

            show that achieving any sort of financial success with a book is a
            Sisyphean task, and even in the biggest success cases, publishers
            end up taking a hefty chunk of the revenue. Meanwhile, authors
            writing on Patreon can theoretically, with just 2000 true fans of
            their work, earn over $100k a year.</span

            >This shift in incentives leads to online fiction, native to the age
            of the internet. Works are mostly free to view and are published in
            chapters as serials, just like our favorite Netflix shows, or the
            great literary works of old in their newspaper feuilletons (see:
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo"
              target="_blank"
              >The Count of Monte Cristo</a
            >). The difference is that now, creators can monetize by using
            platforms like Patreon to give exclusive benefits to their most
            devoted fans. This can include things such as a measure of influence
            over the story, a community with other fans, and most importantly
            advance viewing of the chapters. From a number's perspective, Li
            Jin's

              >1,000 True Fans</a
            >) both show the potential of this model â€” just by charging patrons
            $5/mo, a simple audience of 1,700 fans will net an author a steady
            six-figure income. This absolutely changes the way authors can
            support themselves.

            There's also an argument to be made regarding the quality of
            stories. While publishers have played an important role in
            distribution because they are a quality filter on the entrance of
            new books into the market, they also have front-loaded distribution
            costs, meaning that they can only take a risk on a book if they
            predict it will do well. As a result, they can raise the floor on
            the quality of books that come out, but also fundamentally limit the
            distribution + success of works that break the mold.

            Web serials are a different story. Authors are free to publish
            whatever and whenever they want, and can be wildly more creative
            with the structure, themes, and form of the stories they write. The
            result is that while the average story quality does plummet, the
            best works soar far higher than anything seen before.

            The dimensions this can take place on are extremely varied. For
            instance, worlds can be uniquely meticulous in their detail yet
            breathtaking in their expansiveness. In a web serial, the authors
            can offer readers a branching web of optional side-stories accessed
            by embedded links, to be explored at a user's leisure. Want to
            investigate an intriguing personal relationship, or just dive deeper
            into this obscure aspect of the world? Authors can also play with
            unique story forms, such as hidden (black) text indicating secret
            events hidden in the background, only revealable if you suspect
            something and highlight the right areas.

            What I'm particularly excited about is how this world is just
            getting started. There are so many ways for literature to continue
            evolving, once it adapts to the expressive power of the internet and
            technology. One key idea is interactivity, harkening to prehistoric
            oral traditions, which involved the audience as participants in the
            stories being told. Another is personalization â€” books are static,
            but people are individuals, preferring slightly different stories,
            perhaps ones with a greater focus on character development, or
            cultural worldbuilding, or political intrigue. Web serials are
            swimming in the water of technology, and we can expect to see so
            many new literary experiences in the upcoming few years as people
            discover what this old medium, taken in a new light, can do.

            As a longtime fan of the scene, I'm proud to support so many
            incredible authors and stories. If you're interested in jumping down

            roles, and narratives â€” actually drive the world. It follows a girl
            Named the Squire, apprenticed to the Black Knight who conquered her
            homeland. One of the most unique universes I've ever seen, with
            intelligent characters navigating a chess-like board of Stories
            where one misstep can place them in a Role where their Fate is to
            die.

            villain, and dives head-first, unprepared, into the world of
            'capes'. Amazing at exploring the psychology of superpowered
            individuals, interaction and application of superpowers, and the
            types of societal dynamics / interests that would need to exist in
            the world for typical superhero tropes to be realistic.

            Holmes, this is a story with a delightful hard magic system that is
