            I've always loved stories. My dad used to tell me he would toss
            books across the room just to force himself to stop reading, and
            that obsession definitely carried over to me. When I was young, I
            frequently lost days in novels, and I spent more hours reading lore
            than actually playing any of the games they belonged to.

            But my biggest addiction of all was a different kind of storytelling
            â€” web serials. Even now, after 15 years of quietly reading them,
            it's still a niche, and mentioning them tends to get polite smiles
            and general confusion. But I can't shake the feeling that I'm spying
            the glint of something special, something hidden from the mainstream
            eye.

            When people first hear "web serial", trashy fanfiction is what first
            comes to mind. Admittedly, there's some truth to the stereotypes.
            They say that most of the internet is garbage, and unfortunately a
            large portion of fanfiction does echo that trend. But I've also
            spent years reading stories with worlds that eclipse anything I've
            found on the bookshelves. In many ways, these stories are what
            dominate the creative spaces of my mind.

            Serialized storytelling itself isn't new, of course. Anime, manga,
            and TV series have thrived on weekly episodes for decades. Web
            serials function in a similar way, releasing chapters regularly.
            Every week, I look forward to the days when a new chapter drops,
            just like millions of people wait for the next episode of their
            favorite shows.

            What I love most is the freedom that web serials offer authors. It's
            obvious when you look at each story's diversity of form. Traditional
            publishing demands a finished manuscript, predictability, and
            cautious publishers hesitant to bet on creative risks. Online
            authors, though, can share their stories chapter-by-chapter,
            directly engaging readers as the narrative unfolds. There's no
            distribution cost, and no middleman that skews incentives.

            This direct connection is what makes web serials work. Readers
            financially support authors through platforms like Patreon,
            subscribing for early chapters or special extras. Li Jin's concept

            This frees authors from the editorial oversight of a publisher,
            giving them the freedom to fully implement their vision. My favorite
            stories create new sub-genres â€” they involve world dynamics based on
            meta-narratives, investigations into superhero psychology and
            political theory, or explore unique concepts like a Victorian-era
            biopunk thriller. Serializing the content leads to living
            communities that can make story choices and produce a kaleidoscope
            of speculation.

            In a way, web serials remind me of classics like

            or Dickens's classics, which were originally published in newspaper
            feuilletons, chapter-by-chapter. Today the internet enhances this
            tradition, adding interactivity and community discussion, and making
            storytelling dynamic and engaging.

            I'm especially excited about the untapped possibilities. The web
            naturally supports interactive and personalized narratives,
            branching storylines, or side-stories accessible through hyperlinks.
            The best authors are already playing with these ideas, figuring out
            how to use them to broaden their worlds, and tease alternative
            perspectives.

            homeland. One of the most unique universes I've ever seen, with
