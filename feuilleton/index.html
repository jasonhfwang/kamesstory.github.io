            I'm a huge fan of web serials. It's a niche interest, but my
            contrarian opinion is that web serials are both the future of
            writing and its most powerful medium. This is at odds with how the
            general public perceives them â€” as trashy, cheap, and low-quality â€”
            but I've spent enough years in the community to know they can shine
            as brightly as the most beloved works of popular fiction. People
            dream of Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere, or marvel at the rich sands of
            Dune, but the most compelling worlds I've seen have been found
            online.

            This is obviously a pretty bold claim, but I do think that there are
            some major structural advantages to online fiction that make it
            possible. The most important of these by far is the business model
            that web serials rely on.

            Historically, writing stories has had extremely front-loaded costs,
            is inaccessible, or otherwise has significant operational overhead.
            The only two avenues open to authors were the traditional publishing
            model, and the self-publishing model. With the traditional model,
            authors first must write a complete manuscript of their work. Only
            after this can the author pitch publishers for distribution. If they
            are lucky enough to be signed, the publisher takes over the story
            and handles marketing, distribution, and warehousing. The advantage
            for the author is that the publisher handles all marginal costs
            after story creation, and of course they can get a large cash
            advance. However, because the publisher monopolizes distribution,
            they can also capture a significant portion of a story's ultimate
            lifetime value.
          </span>
        </div>
        <div class="content-body">
          <span>
            The second option is the self-publishing model. In this model, the
            author still has to complete their entire manuscript before they can
            make a single cent. The author must handle all the marketing,
            distribution, and warehousing of their stories, and pay for that
            out-of-pocket. The advantage, however, is that the author retains
            100% of the profits, and that all rights to the book are retained.
          </span>
        </div>
        <div class="content-body">
          <span>
            The model of web serials is completely different, and allows authors
            to not only trivially distribute their stories, but do so in a way
            that lets them retain all profits, and make money earlier. Most
            importantly, because the internet enables zero marginal cost
            distribution, authors are able to charge in a way that adheres more
            closely to the true cost of writing a book, which is the
            worldbuilding and creative process.
          </span>
        </div>
        <div class="content-body">
          <span>
            To do this, web serial authors release their stories incrementally
            in chapters. Authors then monetize the continuous attention from
            their most devoted fans, instead of charging for every view. This is
            similar to how people pay extra money for "unnecessary" merch and
            tickets to see their favorite musicians, despite the ability to
            listen to music for free on streaming services. In web serials,
            obsessed fans subscribe to advanced chapters and special
            story-shaping privileges. Authors thus break out from the power
            dynamics of an author-publisher relationship, and gain the ability
            to extract value directly from the stories they're building.

            >What does this look like in terms of numbers? For the traditional
            publisher-led model, sources like
            <a href="https://bookstat.com/" target="_blank">Bookstat</a> paint a
            bleak picture of revenues for the majority of authors, showing that
            achieving even self-supporting incomes with a book is impossible for
            the vast majority of authors. Even in the biggest success cases,
            publishers end up taking a hefty chunk of the revenue.

            This is different with online fiction. Works are mostly free to view
            and new chapters are published weekly, similar to shows on streaming
            services like Netflix, or the great literary works of old in their
            newspaper feuilletons (see:
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo"
              target="_blank"
              >The Count of Monte Cristo</a
            >). Authors use platforms like Patreon to give exclusive benefits to
            their most devoted fans, such as a measure of influence over the
            story, a community with other fans, and most importantly advance
            viewing of the chapters. Li Jin's
            <a

            (or the original, Kevin Kelly's

              >1,000 True Fans</a
            >) both show the potential of this model â€” just by charging patrons
            $5/mo, a simple audience of 1,700 fans will net an author a steady
            six-figure income. This absolutely changes the way authors can
            support themselves.

            This also enables an improvement to the quality of stories. While
            publishers have played an important role in distribution because
            they are a filter on the entrance of new books into the market, they
            also have front-loaded distribution costs, meaning that they can
            only take a risk on a book if they predict it will do well. As a
            result, they raise the floor on the quality of books that come out,
            but also fundamentally limit the distribution + success of works
            that break the mold.

            Web serials are a different story. Authors can publish whatever and
            whenever they want, and therefore they can be wildly more creative
            with the structure, themes, and form of the stories they write. The
            result is that while the average story quality does plummet, the
            best works soar.

          <span>
            This, in addition to the fundamental medium on which online fiction
            takes place, enables entirely new dimensions of storytelling. For
            instance, worlds can be uniquely meticulous in their detail yet
            breathtaking in their expansiveness. In a web serial, the authors
            can offer readers a branching web of optional side-stories accessed
            by embedded links, to be explored at a user's leisure. Want to
            investigate an intriguing personal relationship, or just dive deeper
            into this obscure aspect of the world? Authors can also play with
            unique story forms, such as hidden (black) text indicating secret
            events hidden in the background, only revealable if you suspect
            something and highlight the right areas.

            What I'm particularly excited about is how this world is just
            getting started. There are so many ways for literature to continue
            evolving, once it adapts to the expressive power of the internet and
            technology. One key idea is interactivity, harkening to prehistoric
            oral traditions, which involved the audience as participants in the
            stories being told. Another is personalization â€” books are static,
            but people are individuals, preferring slightly different stories,
            perhaps ones with a greater focus on character development, or
            cultural worldbuilding, or political intrigue. Web serials are
            swimming in the water of technology, and we can expect to see so
            many new literary experiences in the upcoming few years as people
            discover what this old medium, taken in a new light, can do.

            As a longtime fan of the scene, I'm proud to support so many

            Named the Squire, apprenticed to the Black Knight who conquered her
            homeland. One of the most unique universes I've ever seen, with
            intelligent characters navigating a chess-like board of Stories
            where one misstep can place them in a Role where their Fate is to
            die.

            and dives head-first, unprepared, into the world of 'capes'. Amazing
            at exploring the psychology of superpowered individuals, interaction
