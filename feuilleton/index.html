            Web serials are pretty underrepresented in the literary world, and I
            find that they're often dismissed of as shallower, less
            sophisticated imitations of published works. As a longtime
            participant in the scene, I've always found this to be so bizarre.
            Historically, widely-acclaimed literary works like The Count of
            Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers, and Great Expectations were
            originally published as serials in newspaper
            <i>feuilletons</i>. Their modern-day counterparts live on the web,
            and creator platforms like Patreon enable an entire new generation
            of writers to have complete control over the style & direction of
            their stories, avoiding the high dependency of traditional writers
            on the approval and editorial interests of publishing companies.
            This has resulted in a variety of incredibly creative works,
            spanning genres and ideas that are not well-explored in the literary
            cosmos of published books. As a fan of the scene, here are some of
            my favorites:

              href="https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/"
              target="_blank"
              >Worm and Ward â†—</a
            >, a hyper-realistic superhero story that makes The Boys / Marvel
            feel as shallow as DC. It follows the story of a teenager with a
            seemingly mediocre superpower who is forced to become a villain and
            dives head-first, unprepared, into the world of 'capes'. Amazing at
            exploring the psychology of superpowered individuals, interaction
            and application of superpowers, and societal dynamics / interests
            that would need to exist in the world for typical superhero tropes
            to be realistic.

              >A Practical Guide to Evil â†—</a
            >, a story set in a world where the logic of stories â€”Â their tropes,
            roles, and narratives â€”Â actually drive the world. It follows a girl
            Named the Squire, apprenticed to the Black Knight who conquered her
            homeland. One of the most unique universes I've ever seen, with
            brilliant characters navigating a chess-like board of Stories where
            one misstep can place them in a Role where they are destined to die.

              >Twig â†—</a
            >, a biopunk story that follows several orphans in a world where
            bioengineering is developed in the early 1800s. A surprisingly
            personal and introspective thriller in a very unique, alien setting.

              target="_blank"
              >Mother of Learning â†—</a
            >, a progression fantasy following a magic-academy student who gets
            trapped in an endless time loop and has to figure out why he's there
            and how to escape. A mix of Groundhog Day + Harry Potter + Sherlock
            Holmes, this is a story with a delightful hard magic system that is
            somehow both deeply intricate and understandable. No deus ex
            machinas or handwaved logic here â€” when details are revealed,
            everything clicks like you knew it all along.
