            I'm a huge fan of web serials. Most people regard literature written
            online as something cheap or trashy â€” admittedly, that stereotype
            does hold water for a large portion of online fiction â€” but I've
            spent enough years digging around the community, watching it grow,
            to know that online works contain gems that outshine even the
            brightest works of popular literature. People dream of Brandon
            Sanderson's Cosmere, or marvel at the deep history of Worm and its
            sequels, but the richest worlds I have seen have been found online.
            So why does nobody know about it?

            The most obvious reason is that people tend to subconsciously
            cheapen the value of free things â€” especially a book. If it's so
            good, why doesn't the author monetize it? This ties in with the
            second question most people have: "if this author is serious about
            writing, why don't they just publish something instead?" What people
            don't realize is that the economics and tools that writers have
            access to have changed drastically in the last 20 years. One quick
            glance at
            <a href="https://bookstat.com/" target="_blank">Bookstat</a> will
            tell you that achieving any sort of financial success with a book is
            a Sisyphean task, and even in the biggest success cases, publishers
            end up taking a hefty chunk of the revenue. Simultaneously with this
            realization, creator platforms like Patreon risen, allowing creators
            to directly and sustainably monetize their works on an ongoing
            basis, instead of a product that requires hefty initial effort, and
            a large investment to print and market just for an unlikely return.

            >The world that emerges is that of online fiction, native to the age
            of the internet. Works are free to view, and are published as
            serials in chapters, like the great literary works of old in their
            newspaper feuilletons (see:
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo"
              target="_blank"
              >The Count of Monte Cristo</a
            >). Creators monetize by using platforms like Patreon to allow
            access to exclusive Q&As, direct relationships with patrons, and
            advance viewing of chapters to the most devoted (read: hooked) fans.
            Like gaming, drops of fanart and merch are available to supplement
            the author's steady income from these platforms. It seems like
            everyone's read Li Jin's iconic
            <a

              >100 True Fans</a

            post (or the original, Kevin Kelly's
            <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" target="_blank"
              >1,000 True Fans</a
            >), but it's true â€” just by charging patrons $5/mo, a simple
            audience of 1,700 fans will net an author a steady six-figure
            income. This absolutely changes the way authors can support
            themselves.

            As a result, the number of high-quality stories online has exploded.
            Because there's no filter on the production of content, daring &
            wildly creative ideas float up through the foaming sea of creation,
            unconstrained by the genericizing interests of publishers. Without
            editors to massage stories into the known molds that can preditably
            sell, web serials are free to reach out and envision whatever their
            authors can dream. The worlds that arise are incredibly meticulous
            in their detail yet breathtaking in their expansiveness. In a web
            serial, the authors can easily take their time and offer readers a
            branching web of optional side-stories, whether to investigate
            intriguing personal relationships, or relate the details of
            political intrigues.

            And this world is just getting started. There are so many ways for
            literature to continue evolving, once it adapts to the expressive
            power of the internet and technology. One key idea is interactivity,
            harkening to prehistoric oral traditions, which involved the
            audience as participants in the stories being told. Another is
            personalization â€” books are static, but people are individuals,
            preferring slightly different stories, perhaps ones with a greater
            focus on character development, or cultural worldbuilding, or
            political intrigue. Web serials swim in the water of technology, and
            we can expect to see so many new literary experiences in the
            upcoming few years as people discover what this old medium, taken in
            a new light, can do.

            As a longtime fan of the scene, I'm proud to support so many
            incredible authors and stories. If you're interested in jumping down
            the rabbit hole, here are some of my favorites:

        <!--             
          non-existent filter and endless production -> exercise in curation but why curate at
          production when you can curate the end result? why sink thousands? -->
        <!-- Endless reimaginings of worlds â€”Â what if Pokemon were realistic? -->
        <!-- It's an indulging in curiosity and a playfulness that eclipses
          literary norms  -->
        <!-- Worlds I've never seen or think anybody has talked
          about  -->
        <!-- The form! Colors and font sizes and ...  -->
        <!-- The episodic reading,
          hanging onto every chapter, chatting with the community -> the great
          oral tradition, before writers dictated their worlds and dragged
          everyone else in their wake  -->
        <!-- It's so deep because there's no
          publishing company to make the story more "generic" or conform to
          the traditional arcs. -->

            >, a story set in a world where the logic of stories â€”Â their tropes,
            roles, and narratives â€”Â actually drive the world. It follows a girl
            Named the Squire, apprenticed to the Black Knight who conquered her
            homeland. One of the most unique universes I've ever seen, with
            intelligent characters navigating a chess-like board of Stories
            where one misstep can place them in a Role where they are fated to
            die.

            >, a hyper-realistic superhero story that makes The Boys / Marvel
            feel as shallow as DC. It follows the story of a teenager with a
            pretty unconventional superpower who is forced to become a villain,
            and dives head-first, unprepared, into the world of 'capes'. Amazing
            at exploring the psychology of superpowered individuals, interaction
            and application of superpowers, and the types of societal dynamics /
            interests that would need to exist in the world for typical
            superhero tropes to be realistic.

            and how to escape. A mix of Groundhog Day + Harry Potter + Sherlock
            Holmes, this is a story with a delightful hard magic system that is
            somehow both deeply intricate and understandable. No deus ex

            everything clicks.
