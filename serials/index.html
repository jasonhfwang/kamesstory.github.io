            My dad used to tell me he would toss books across the room just to
            force himself to stop reading, and that obsession definitely carried
            over to me. When I was young, I would lose days in novels. I
            probably spent more hours reading lore than actually playing any of
            the games they belonged to.

            But my biggest storytelling addiction of all was web serials. Even
            now, after 15 years of quietly reading them, it's still a niche, and
            mentioning them tends to get polite smiles and general confusion.
            Frankly, they're overlooked. But I'm the type of person who chases
            ideas that tickle my mind, and web serials are the only form of
            fiction that has consistently pushed beyond the expected, and
            challenged my conceptions of how a story should behave. Brandon
            Sanderson? Not even close.

            Here are a few of the worlds that have convinced my friends, and
            hopefully will convince you as well:

            set in a world protected from the outside's lethal Glare by the
            cavernous protection of the Firmament. In spite of the fantastical
            setting, the story is centered around characters with complex
            motivations and flaws, centered on a world rich with intrigue. Very
            character-driven, but with the dashes of the delight that make the
            best fantasy stories so captivating.

            bioengineering is developed during the Victorian era. An incredibly

            unique, alien setting.

            >a story set in a world where the logic of stories â€” their tropes,
            roles, and narratives â€” actually drive the world. It follows a girl
            named the Squire, apprenticed to the Black Knight who conquered her
            homeland. One of the most unique universes I've ever seen, with
            intelligent characters navigating through a weave of Stories where
            their Role is to either win or die.

            >a hyper-realistic superhero story that makes The Boys / Marvel feel
            as shallow as DC. It follows the story of a teenager with a pretty
            unconventional superpower who is forced to become a villain, and
            dives head-first, unprepared, into the world of 'capes'. Amazing at
            exploring the psychology of superpowered individuals, application of
            superpowers, and the types of societal dynamics / interests that
            would need to exist in the world for typical superhero tropes to be
            rational.
