            My dad used to tell me he would toss books across the room just to
            force himself to stop reading, and that obsession definitely carried
            over to me. When I was young, I would lose days in novels. I
            probably spent more hours reading lore than actually playing any of
            the games they belonged to.

            But my biggest storytelling addiction of all was web serials. I've
            been quietly reading them for over 15 years, yet it's remained a
            very underground niche, and mentioning them tends to just elicit
            polite smiles and lukewarm curiosity. They're definitely overlooked.
            But as a person who likes having my brain tickled by quirky and
            creative ideas, web serials are the only form of fiction that has
            consistently pushed beyond the expected, and challenged my
            conceptions of how a story should behave. Brandon Sanderson is
            great, yes, but he doesn't come close.

            Here are a few of the worlds that have convinced my friends, and
            hopefully will convince you as well:

            set in a world protected from the outside's lethal Glare by the
            cavernous protection of the Firmament. Despite being set in a very
            unusual world, the story is centered around very real characters
            with some of the clearest motivations and flaws I've ever seen,
            boistered by brilliant character interactions and a world with a
            nuanced history. Very character-driven, but with the dashes of the
            delight that make the best fantasy stories so captivating.

            >a biopunk story that follows several orphans in a world where
            bioengineering is developed during the Victorian era. An incredibly
            personal and introspective coming-of-age story, juxtaposed against a
            very alien setting.

            >a story set in a world where the logic of stories â€” their tropes,
            roles, and narratives â€” actually drive the world. It follows a girl
            named the Squire, apprenticed to the Black Knight who conquered her
            homeland. One of the most unique universes I've ever seen, with
            intelligent characters navigating through a weave of Stories and
            Roles where they're fated to either win or die.

            >a hyper-realistic superhero story that makes The Boys / Marvel feel
            as shallow as DC. It follows the story of a teenager with a pretty
            unconventional superpower who is forced to become a villain, and
            dives head-first, unprepared, into the world of 'capes'. Amazing at
            exploring the psychology of superpowered individuals, application of
            superpowers, and the types of societal dynamics / interests that
            would need to exist in the world for typical superhero tropes to be
            rational.
