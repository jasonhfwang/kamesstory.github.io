- The perfect traveling experience is one that is so personal to each individual. In my most recent trip to New Zealand, I didn't come away with the feeling I wanted even though it was an amazing trip — I did one of the Great Walks (Kepler, an awesome experience, and my first time backpacking!), cave river tubing, kayaking in Milford Sound, etc. But it wasn't as deep of an experience as I was expecting, especially in the context of other transformative trips I've taken in the past. I feel like it must be because I wasn't completely immersed, subsumed into the different environment, the way I have been during study abroad (cultural immersion) and solo travel (living in myself + cherishing every small human interaction). I'm reminded of [this great quote from a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4SDBVaUboc) where James Suzman describes an important experience for most people that is, unfortunately, becoming more fleeting — to "experience another way of living and being to the point that it makes the strange familiar, and the familiar strange". That's one of the most visceral impacts of great travel. Is there a way to dip into that in shorter trips — chatting with strangers, leaning into uncomfortable situations, reaching out of the bubble of leisure we expect and hold on to? Or is it, ironically, [to expect and plan less](https://qz.com/quartzy/1633181/the-key-to-a-perfect-summer-is-making-absolutely-zero-plans), and therefore more greatly cherish every unexpected delight?
- We live in an age where we, as technologists, have the most individual power and leverage to move the world in the history of humanity. It's absolutely amazing to be alive right now. Where are all the people who are interested in working on our most challening problems in construction, climate, government, etc?
- There's no way to appreciate a scene and pay attention to as many details as you do when you paint. Even if you just sit down and stare, it's so hard to notice the details of the texture of the leaves on the trees, and the rock, and the sea. I should carry a tool to zero in on the present whenever I'm traveling, whether that's a tiny watercolor book, a camera, or a little poetry notebook.
- There's a huge distinction between working with / trusting / relying upon your subconscious patterns of thought, and being driven by your feelings. The former generates insights derived from accumulated subconscious / minute details, which are distinct from what your logical brain notices and therefore can be hugely valuable. It also incidentally requires very little active attention, which is great since effort expended is always a constant O(1). However, because these patterns are driven by emotional / instinctive machinery that might not apply to a given situation, understanding how your subconscious works is critical to applying its insights effectively. That's why the latter (being entirely driven by feelings) is bad — you divorce your decision entirely from logic.
- The way "the other" is depicted in fantasy games, movies, and art can be so much more sophisticated and interesting. The basic template nowadays is to depict "evil" with "barbaric" architectures of bone and tattered canvas / hide (or brutalist black stone/steel, think Mordor). But the best villains are those with nuance, and it should be the same when it comes to things like culture and language. I was recently looking at [some examples of traditional architecture in Guizhou](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cjz71ckKgQO/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=), and there was this strange perspective shift in my head, where I suddenly saw wood architecture as effectively massacring trees and building (with their dead bodies) incredibly elegant structures. Inducing these more subtle senses of unease reliably would be amazing, since we would have to reconcile a clear aesthetic appreciation of beauty with something slightly unsettling. A few films skirt around this idea, like Annihilation.
- Capturing the quintessential essence of thoughts / attitudes / beliefs to remember far into the future is actually very difficult. It isn't as simple as writing thoughts down — there's underlying modes of perception and belief systems that change over time, and to fully contextualize thoughts you need to capture that hidden essence as well.
- What a cool microblog: https://udara.io/microblog/. Also his post on [reinventing his blog](https://udara.io/reinventing-this-blog) contains some really interesting ideas (e.g. Zettelkästen) that I've never seen before.
- After my recent health scare, I've had such a fundamental shift in thinking on exercise. It really is [a celebration](https://external-preview.redd.it/VDPvosbeTFKlG1CXSzynW6L-ifguJBMw8TFBeshnX68.jpg?auto=webp&s=88c3da021cc0f3003992ddc6e5904221ceb0c119) of what I can do, not a punishment required to maintain my health. It's hard to emotionally embrace that idea until you literally (think you) can't push yourself anymore.
- I'd love to own a farm where all the produce variants are from before the early 1900s breeding programs (e.g. actual heirloom tomatoes and heritage-breed chickens). Even though crops have been "genetically modified" (phenotypes selected for by people) throughout all of history, I suspect the historical selection criteria for a "good plant" was much more holistic (e.g. primarily taste rather than optics and size) than those in the modern-day. On that note, I don't know why people don't do restaurant versions of [Tasting History](https://www.youtube.com/@TastingHistory) — I would love to go to a restaurant specializing in ancient Roman or [indigenous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocm6DRIF9oU&t=1s) food.
