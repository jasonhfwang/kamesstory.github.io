- Mindful indulgence

  - I recently was chatting with a new friend who had a transformative experience at a Vipassana meditation retreat, and I started thinking a lot about my own habits and forms of relaxation, and how I don't necessarily feel the most relaxed or satisfied when I just indulge cravings. In contrast, I'm much more fulfilled when I'm deliberate in enjoying things instead of just mindlessly giving in without agency. This doesn't mean necessarily always holding out (although I'm guilty of enjoying the satisfaction of doing that too, e.g. with eating bland salads without dressing). Instead it means occasionally taking the time to put in more effort, focus, & dive into the enjoyment of things that give me pleasure. That includes indulging, ironically — if I want to eat something sweet, I don't just eat it and be done with it. I can savor it and turn it into an entire experience.

- Infinite detail

  - There's no way to appreciate a scene and pay attention to as many details as you do when you paint. Even if you just sit down and stare, it's so hard to notice the details of the texture of the leaves on the trees, and the rock, and the sea. I should carry a tool to zero in on the present whenever I'm traveling, whether that's a tiny watercolor book, a camera, or a little poetry notebook.

- A lever under the world

  - We live in an age where we, as technologists, have the most individual power and leverage to move the world in the history of humanity. It's absolutely amazing to be alive right now. Where are all the people who are interested in working on our most challening problems in construction, climate, government, etc?

- Subconscious

  - I've always been really happy with how much I understand and rely on my instincts and subconscious. To me, there's a huge difference between working with / trusting / relying upon your subconscious patterns of thought, and being driven by your feelings. The former involves using millennia of honed machinery to get insights derived from accumulated minute subconscious details, which are distinct from what your logical brain can notice and are really valuable. It also runs on its own, which is great since it doesnt require much effort. However, because these patterns are driven by emotional / instinctive machinery that might not apply to a given situation, understanding how your subconscious works and where it is designed to be effective is critical to applying its insights effectively. That's why the latter (being entirely driven by feelings) is bad — you divorce your decision entirely from logic.

- Inversion of banality

  - The way "the other" is depicted in fantasy games, movies, and art can be so much more sophisticated and interesting. The basic template nowadays is to depict "evil" as something clearly alien, such as with architectures of bone and tattered canvas / hide (or brutalist black stone/steel, think Mordor). But the best antagonists are those with nuance, subvert expectations, or rely on the flawed perspectives of the protagonists. It should be the same when it comes to artistic depictions of evil in fantasy. I was recently looking at [some examples of traditional architecture in Guizhou](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cjz71ckKgQO/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=), and there was this strange perspective shift in my head, where I suddenly saw wood architecture as effectively massacring trees and building (with their dead bodies) incredibly elegant structures. This was interesting because it was one of those situations where seeing "more clearly" led to a complete inversion of experience of something totally normal. Inducing these more subtle senses of unease reliably would be amazing, since we would have to reconcile a clear aesthetic appreciation of beauty with something slightly unsettling.

- Complete mental snapshots

  - Capturing the quintessential essence of thoughts / attitudes / beliefs to remember far into the future is actually very difficult. It isn't as simple as writing thoughts down — there's underlying modes of perception and belief systems that change over time, and to fully contextualize thoughts you need to capture that hidden essence as well.

  - For example, a few years ago I wrote this down: "Most of people's time is spent inventing things to do, in order to avoid doing important work that they're dreading." This feels like a vague truism, but I have no idea as to what prompted this thought (and what made it feel like such an important insight at that point in my life, that I wrote it down). It's pretty evident that looking at that quote, the real thought to note down was buried at the intersection between those words, and the specific circumstance in my life that made that idea critically important. But I don't have any recollection of that anymore, and none of that contextualizing information has been written down. I've recently become more interested in capturing those ideas more completely.

- Fulfilling travel

  - I've been thinking a lot about my recent trip to New Zealand, and the difference between the feelings I expected and the ones I had. At the center of it all is the question, "what do I want out of travel"? I don't think it's a question that most people really deeply consider, and it goes beyond the simplicity of "what vibe do I want to feel". For me, it's fulfillment in placing yourself in a completely different context than I'm used to — stretching muscles I've forgotten about, and living what is essentially a completely different life.

  - In my recent trip to New Zealand, I didn't come away with the feeling I wanted even though it was an amazing trip — I did one of the Great Walks (Kepler, an awesome experience, and my first time backpacking!), cave river tubing, kayaking in Milford Sound, etc. But it wasn't as deep of an experience as I was expecting, especially in the context of other transformative trips I've taken in the past. A large part of that is because I wasn't completely immersed, bought into the new environment, the way I have been during study abroad (cultural immersion) and solo travel (living in myself + cherishing every small human interaction).

  - I'm reminded of [this great quote from James Suzman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4SDBVaUboc) where he describes an important experience for most people that is, unfortunately, becoming more fleeting — to "experience another way of living and being to the point that it makes the strange familiar, and the familiar strange". That's one of the most visceral impacts of great travel. Is there a way to dip into that in shorter trips — chatting with strangers, leaning into uncomfortable situations, reaching out of the bubble of leisure we expect and hold on to? Or is it, ironically, [to expect and plan less](https://qz.com/quartzy/1633181/the-key-to-a-perfect-summer-is-making-absolutely-zero-plans), and therefore more greatly cherish every unexpected delight?

- Microblog

  - Doesn't [Udara's microblog](https://udara.io/microblog/) seem a bit familiar? I'm a huge fan of noting down small thoughts, so I copied his format (it's perfect for me)! Also, his post on [reinventing his blog](https://udara.io/reinventing-this-blog) contains some really interesting ideas (e.g. Zettelkästen) that I've never seen before.

- Soaring

  - After my recent health scare, there's been this large fundamental shift in my feelings on exercise. I've read for a long time about how exercise is [a celebration](https://external-preview.redd.it/VDPvosbeTFKlG1CXSzynW6L-ifguJBMw8TFBeshnX68.jpg?auto=webp&s=88c3da021cc0f3003992ddc6e5904221ceb0c119) of what I can do, not a punishment required to maintain my health. But there's always a disconnect between rationally knowing and emotionally embracing an idea. Once I felt what I thought were the limitations of my body, I finally felt that click in my mind. It's such a beautiful feeling to move and feel so alive when I do.

- Cottagecore

  - I've been obsessed with the idea of product and livestock variants for a while now, and I've been thinking about how amazing it'd be to own a farm where all the produce are variants from before the early 1900s breeding programs (e.g. actual heirloom tomatoes and heritage-breed chickens). Even though crops have been "genetically modified" (phenotypes selected for by people) throughout all of history, I suspect the historical selection criteria for a "good plant" was much more holistic (e.g. primarily taste rather than superficial optics and size) than those in the modern-day.

  - On that note, I don't know why people don't do restaurant versions of [Tasting History](https://www.youtube.com/@TastingHistory) — I would love to go to a restaurant specializing in ancient Roman, Chinese or [indigenous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocm6DRIF9oU&t=1s) food.
