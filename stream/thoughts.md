- forever clothing

  - What even is the concept of timeless fashion? This was a trend in the past, where people wanted to focus only on high-quality basics and timeless pieces, and for a while I thought that for me it could be the end of fashion. I've only since realized that this is missing an absolutely critical aspect — self-expression, which I'm sure is obvious to actual fashion enthusiasts. To me, to be timeless is not to stick just with whatever has withstood the test of time, but also to find some core kernel of yourself that you can express through clothing. If you find that kernel and can match it with dress, then it's also timeless, _for you_. Here's some qualities that "forever clothes" should have in my eyes:

  - 1. Accent good physical qualities, and hide bad ones.
    2. Avoid being trendy for the sake of trendiness.
    3. Capture who you are (crucially, core parts of personality that aren't just phases of life), or convey impressions that you want to convey.

  - The best clothes, in my eyes, must excel in at least 2 of the above principles and do decently in the remaining condition. My goal is to find more of these pieces and build more trendy items on top of that collection.

- china

  - The last time I went to China before this past trip was 2016, about 8 years ago. At that point, I was still young, so I never picked up on the subtleties and interesting dynamics of Chinese society. The most striking one I observed this past trip was that China is a lesson in contrast. China is not a tokenizable experience, nor is it a homogenous one. Things that should be in opposition do in fact exist hand in hand, which makes for a complex and interesting society. Here are some anecdotes:

  - - Older generation vs. younger generation. Many of the older generation grew up in pre-market economics society (e.g. cultural revolution times), and are heavily influenced by their experiences there. They're the boats that have risen with the tide. I've literally overheard (normal) folks saying that now they're retired, they have too much money that they can't invest and just need to spend it on luxury goods or expensive foreign travel. There's also a hyper-rich new generation, the heirs to tycoon fortunes, who look down on the old guard and normal society and desperately pretend to be greater than Chinese, traveling and studying in places like France and the UK. Then there's the ordinary younger generation, which is stuck under the burden of 9-9-6 and the impossibility of achieving the same level of success as their parents. They don't even and can't even travel much, to the degree that fellow travelers thought I was weird for being able to go out on a vacation within China "out-of-season".

  - - Old tradition vs. the new China. Everywhere you look, there's an interplay between old buildings and constructions, and the glittering new skyscrapers and neon lights. Aesthetically, one of the most amazing things about the architecture there is the usage of lights to highlight and frame the gorgeous structure of traditional buildings. Things look serene during the day, and glow with a frenetic energy at night.

  - - Tourism infrastructure. Roads and trains and airports are so good in China that all these gorgoeus natural attractions are so easy to access. This lets a much larger population experience the beauty of nature, but the contrast is that the natural beauty is quite literally crowded out by the sheer volume of people. I found myself bizarrely partially wishing that Chinese infrastructure were worse, so that the resulting experiences would be nicer.

  - - Chains and businesses. I was struck by the number of amazing new chains in China (I love love love love love Chagee and Luckin Coffee), and how it contrasts with little holes in the wall serving traditional food, and older and grander classical restaurants. It seems like a thriving business culture where the old and the new can meet. There's a preservation of tradition, but there's also a very real sense of a massive culinary revolution and innovation.

  - - Fashion status games. China is interesting because as a manufacturing hub, they actually produce a lot of clothing for the rest of the world, including famous and high-quality brands. I was in Guangzhou next to the wholesale markets and they were pumping out boutique Korean fashion for 10% of the price. Of course, the fakes in China are legendary, and what results is a rapidly iterating fashion status game. Previously, famous brands were the only way to distinguish yourself as a person with means, so that's why Chinese people love them so much. Now, however, a lot more people are able to afford them or can find good fakes, so the status game has iterated towards less branding and instead more of a focus on the quality and style of the product. I wonder how this will evolve as wholesale markets continue to increase their quality and variety. Will categorical status games become moot, or will they just continue to grow more eccentric and niche?

  - - Communist culture. There was an event in one of the tourism sites I was visiting which featured a set of cultural performances, organized by a group that I suspect was sponsored by the CCP. The resulting performance was pretty good, to be honest, but featured narratives centered around the almost-mythical abilities of the People's Liberation Army in disaster. I found the existence of such blatant propaganda to be a bit jarring, especially given the enthusiasm with which it was received by some of the older generation, and the almost disdain I found with the younger generation. I literally overheard a group of people my age leaving the theater saying "what a joke".

- the suitcase index

  - I was just in China and was struck by the experience of just being able to roll my suitcase from my house in one city to the hotel in another, without it really ever leaving my hands. In the US, this is totally a foreign idea, as suitcases leave our hands almost at every junction. The car ride from the house to the airport, the security checkpoints, the carry on overhead bins, the car ride in the last mile, etc. China was different because public transportation and high-speed rail makes it so easy to just roll it continuously to the endpoint. I call this in my head the suitcase index, indicating the percentage of time that a suitcase can be in your hands or easily accessible, which is a proxy for the quality and dominance of the public infrastructure.

- mindful indulgence

  - I recently was chatting with a new friend who had a transformative experience at a Vipassana meditation retreat, and I started thinking a lot about my own habits and forms of relaxation, and how I don't necessarily feel the most relaxed or satisfied when I just indulge cravings. In contrast, I'm much more fulfilled when I'm deliberate in enjoying things instead of just mindlessly giving in without agency. This doesn't mean necessarily always holding out (although I'm guilty of enjoying the satisfaction of doing that too, e.g. with eating bland salads without dressing). Instead it means occasionally taking the time to put in more effort, focus, & dive into the enjoyment of things that give me pleasure. That includes indulging, ironically — if I want to eat something sweet, I don't just eat it and be done with it. I can savor it and turn it into an entire experience.

- infinite detail

  - As we grow older and see more things, our brains add neural shortcuts that
    template experiences and reduce their emotional impact. This is why we don't
    appreciate a scene nearly as much the third time, as the first. The best
    way I've found to combat this is to force myself to pay attention to
    details, such as when you paint. Even if you just sit down and stare, it's
    so hard to notice the details of the texture of the leaves on the trees, and
    the rock, and the sea. My goal is to carry a tool to zero in on the present
    whenever I'm traveling, whether that's a tiny watercolor book, a camera,
    or a little poetry notebook.

- the lever under the world

  - We live in an age where we, as technologists, have the most individual power and leverage to move the world in the history of humanity. It's absolutely amazing to be alive right now. Where are all the people who are interested in working on our most challening problems in construction, climate, government, etc?

- subconscious

  - I've always been really happy with how much I understand and rely on my instincts and subconscious. To me, there's a huge difference between working with / trusting / relying upon your subconscious patterns of thought, and being driven by your feelings. The former involves using millennia of honed machinery to get insights derived from accumulated minute subconscious details, which are distinct from what your logical brain can notice and are really valuable. It also runs on its own, which is great since it doesnt require much effort. However, because these patterns are driven by emotional / instinctive machinery that might not apply to a given situation, understanding how your subconscious works and where it is designed to be effective is critical to applying its insights effectively. That's why the latter (being entirely driven by feelings) is bad — you divorce your decision entirely from logic.

- inversion of banality

  - The way "the other" is depicted in fantasy games, movies, and art can be so much more sophisticated and interesting. The basic template nowadays is to depict "evil" as something clearly alien, such as with architectures of bone and tattered canvas / hide (or brutalist black stone/steel, think Mordor). But the best antagonists are those with nuance, subvert expectations, or rely on the flawed perspectives of the protagonists. It should be the same when it comes to artistic depictions of evil in fantasy. I was recently looking at [some examples of traditional architecture in Guizhou](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cjz71ckKgQO/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=), and there was this strange perspective shift in my head, where I suddenly saw wood architecture as effectively massacring trees and building (with their dead bodies) incredibly elegant structures. This was interesting because it was one of those situations where something I've been trying to do more — seeing "more clearly" — led to a complete inversion of experience of something totally normal. Inducing these more subtle senses of unease reliably would be amazing, since we would have to reconcile a clear aesthetic appreciation of beauty with something slightly unsettling.

- complete mental snapshots

  - Capturing the quintessential essence of thoughts / attitudes / beliefs to remember far into the future is actually very difficult. It isn't as simple as writing thoughts down — there's underlying modes of perception and belief systems that change over time, and to fully contextualize thoughts you need to capture that hidden essence as well.

  - For example, a few years ago I wrote this down: "Most of people's time is spent inventing things to do, in order to avoid doing important work that they're dreading." This feels like a vague truism, but I have no idea as to what prompted this thought (and what made it feel like such an important insight at that point in my life, that I wrote it down). It's pretty evident that looking at that quote, the real thought to note down was buried at the intersection between those words, and the specific circumstance in my life that made that idea critically important. But I don't have any recollection of that anymore, and none of that contextualizing information has been written down. I've recently become more interested in capturing those ideas more completely.

- fulfilling travel

  - I've been thinking a lot about my recent trip to New Zealand, and the difference between the feelings I expected and the ones I had. At the center of it all is the question, "what do I want out of travel"? I don't think it's a question that most people really deeply consider, and it goes beyond the simplicity of "what vibe do I want to feel". For me, it's fulfillment in placing yourself in a completely different context than I'm used to — stretching muscles I've forgotten about, and living what is essentially a completely different life.

  - In my recent trip to New Zealand, I didn't come away with the feeling I wanted even though it was an amazing trip — I did one of the Great Walks (Kepler, an awesome experience, and my first time backpacking!), cave river tubing, kayaking in Milford Sound, etc. But it wasn't as deep of an experience as I was expecting, especially in the context of other transformative trips I've taken in the past. A large part of that is because I wasn't completely immersed, bought into the new environment, the way I have been during study abroad (cultural immersion) and solo travel (living in myself + cherishing every small human interaction).

  - I'm reminded of [this great quote from James Suzman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4SDBVaUboc) where he describes an important experience for most people that is, unfortunately, becoming more fleeting — to "experience another way of living and being to the point that it makes the strange familiar, and the familiar strange". That's one of the most visceral impacts of great travel. Is there a way to dip into that in shorter trips — chatting with strangers, leaning into uncomfortable situations, reaching out of the bubble of leisure we expect and hold on to? Or is it, ironically, [to expect and plan less](https://qz.com/quartzy/1633181/the-key-to-a-perfect-summer-is-making-absolutely-zero-plans), and therefore more greatly cherish every unexpected delight?

- microblog

  - Doesn't [Udara's microblog](https://udara.io/microblog/) seem a bit familiar? I'm a huge fan of noting down small thoughts, so I copied his format (it's perfect for me)! Also, his post on [reinventing his blog](https://udara.io/reinventing-this-blog) contains some really interesting ideas (e.g. Zettelkästen) that I've never seen before.

- soaring

  - After my recent health scare, there's been this large fundamental shift in my feelings on exercise. I've read for a long time about how exercise is [a celebration](https://external-preview.redd.it/VDPvosbeTFKlG1CXSzynW6L-ifguJBMw8TFBeshnX68.jpg?auto=webp&s=88c3da021cc0f3003992ddc6e5904221ceb0c119) of what I can do, not a punishment required to maintain my health. But there's always a disconnect between rationally knowing and emotionally embracing an idea. Once I felt what I thought were the limitations of my body, I finally felt that click in my mind. It's such a beautiful feeling to move and feel so alive when I do.

- cottagecore

  - I've been obsessed with the idea of product and livestock variants for a while now, and I've been thinking about how amazing it'd be to own a farm where all the produce are variants from before the early 1900s breeding programs (e.g. actual heirloom tomatoes and heritage-breed chickens). Even though crops have been "genetically modified" (phenotypes selected for by people) throughout all of history, I suspect the historical selection criteria for a "good plant" was much more holistic (e.g. primarily taste rather than superficial optics and size) than those in the modern-day.

  - On that note, I don't know why people don't do restaurant versions of [Tasting History](https://www.youtube.com/@TastingHistory) — I would love to go to a restaurant specializing in ancient Roman, Chinese or [indigenous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocm6DRIF9oU&t=1s) food.
