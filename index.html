		<p> I love reading fanfiction, especially Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. That one is absolutely <i>amazing</i>.</p>

		<p> I also love watching blacksmithing shows, especially Man at Arms, which makes the most fantastic fantasy weapons.</p>

		<p> Recently, I'm participating in the 2017 Hult Prize Competition as a part of the 3-member Sawiana Enterprises. We are developing a mobile app (courtesy of yours truly) in order to help link refugees and allow them to make connections, learn skills, and grow businesses.</p>

		<p> I am also rushing Round Table SLG at Duke University. I hope I will get in - I love the people, and the atmosphere is a perfect mix of geeky, nerdy, cheerful, and awesome! </p>
